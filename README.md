## Description
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites. Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Install
* Clone the project source code
* Connect to MySQL database with your own database credentials;
```$ mysql -u root -p``` 
* Create the database schema
```mysql> source db/schema.sql;```
* Exit the database
```mysql> exit```
* To verify Node.js installation, type "node -v" in your command line. If Node is absent, access the Node.js website for installation. Subsequently, clone this repository to your machine. Run the following line of code in your terminal to install all the needed packages: 
``` npm i ```
* Populate the database
```$ npm run seed```

## Use
* After installing all the required packages, launch your terminal and execute the following command in the command line:
```$ npm start``
